# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security architecture and audit findings for the Sui Flash Loan DApp. The platform implements a multi-layered security approach following enterprise-grade standards and zero-trust principles.

## Security Architecture Overview

### üîê Zero-Trust Architecture (R1)

**Implementation:**
- All cryptographic keys remain client-side
- No private keys are stored on backend servers
- Transaction signing occurs exclusively in user wallets
- Server provides only unsigned transaction blocks

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Wallet integration uses `@mysten/wallet-kit` for client-side signing
- ‚úÖ Backend never handles or stores private keys
- ‚úÖ All sensitive operations require explicit user approval

### üîÑ RPC Failover System (R2)

**Implementation:**
- Multiple Sui RPC endpoints with automatic failover
- Health monitoring and endpoint rotation
- Circuit breaker pattern for failed endpoints
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts

**Configuration:**
```typescript
const RPC_ENDPOINTS = [
  'https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443',
  'https://sui-testnet.nodeinfra.com',
  'https://testnet.sui.rpcpool.com'
];
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic endpoint switching on failures
- ‚úÖ Health checks implemented for all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Retry logic with exponential backoff

### ‚õΩ Pre-flight Gas Estimation (S3)

**Implementation:**
- Dry-run transactions before execution
- Gas cost validation with safety buffer (20%)
- Maximum gas budget enforcement
- Early failure detection

**Process Flow:**
1. Build transaction block
2. Execute `dryRunTransactionBlock`
3. Validate gas estimate vs. maximum budget
4. Return cost breakdown to user

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ All transactions validated before signing
- ‚úÖ Gas estimates include 20% safety buffer
- ‚úÖ Maximum gas budget enforcement

### üìù Comprehensive Audit Logging (S2)

**Implementation:**
- Structured logging with Winston
- Every operation logged with request ID
- Security events separately tracked
- Performance metrics collected

**Log Categories:**
- Flash loan operations
- Pool management actions
- Security events (rate limiting, unauthorized access)
- System events and performance

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints have audit logging
- ‚úÖ Security events trigger immediate alerts
- ‚úÖ Logs are tamper-evident and immutable

### üö¶ Multi-layer Rate Limiting (R4)

**Implementation:**
- **Layer 1:** Global API rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
- **Layer 2:** Endpoint-specific limits (10 flash loans/min per IP)
- **Layer 3:** Wallet address-based limits (5 loans/min per wallet)
- Redis-based distributed rate limiting

**Configuration:**
```typescript
const rateLimiters = {
  global: { windowMs: 60000, max: 100 },
  flashLoan: { windowMs: 60000, max: 10 },
  wallet: { windowMs: 60000, max: 5 }
};
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple layers of protection
- ‚úÖ Redis-backed for distributed environments
- ‚úÖ Per-wallet limits prevent targeted attacks

### üîÑ Error Boundaries & State Reset (R5)

**Implementation:**
- React Error Boundaries for UI failures
- Automatic state reset on critical errors
- LocalStorage cleanup on wallet disconnect
- Graceful degradation on partial failures

**Reset Mechanisms:**
- Wallet disconnect triggers full state cleanup
- Critical errors force page reload
- Canceled transactions clear form data
- Network errors reset connection state

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Error boundaries catch all React errors
- ‚úÖ State cleanup on wallet disconnect
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of network failures

## Smart Contract Security

### üß† Move Language Security Features

**Capability-Based Security:**
- Object ownership model prevents unauthorized access
- Type system enforces memory safety
- Resource ownership prevents double-spending
- Move Prover for formal verification

**Key Security Measures:**
1. **Access Control:** Only pool owner can pause/upgrade contracts
2. **Balance Validation:** Pool liquidity checked before loans
3. **Atomic Execution:** Loan and repayment in same transaction
4. **Fee Enforcement:** Automatic fee calculation and collection
5. **Reentrancy Protection:** Sui's transaction model prevents reentrancy
6. **Integer Safety:** Move's type system prevents overflow/underflow

**Contract Functions Security:**
```move
// Access control example
public fun pause_pool(pool: &mut FlashLoanPool, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    assert!(tx_context::sender(ctx) == pool.owner, E_UNAUTHORIZED);
    pool.is_paused = true;
}

// Balance validation example
public fun request_flash_loan(pool: &mut FlashLoanPool, amount: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    assert!(!pool.is_paused, E_POOL_PAUSED);
    assert!(amount > 0, E_INVALID_AMOUNT);
    assert!(balance::value(&pool.balance) >= amount, E_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE);
}
```

## Backend Security
